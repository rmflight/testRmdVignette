# testing

This is an extremely simple vignette. 

I want to know when the HTML version gets properly installed. I assume that doing 

```
require(devtools)
build_vignettes()
```

Will generate the html version in the **ints/doc** folder, and that `build()` or `install()` will actually make it possible to see this.
